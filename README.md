## üöÄ Deployment  

### Deploying the Website  

The widget/ webpage is deployed on **[GitHub Pages](https://sameetpatil5.github.io/notion-pomodoro-timer/)**.  

### Embedding into Notion  

1. Go to your Notion page.  
2. Use the `/embed` command in Notion and paste the GitHub Pages link:  

   ```plaintext
   https://sameetpatil5.github.io/notion-pomodoro-timer/
   ```

### Workflow for Updates  

#### When you make changes in `main` and want to test them  

1. **Merge `main` into `staging` to test:**  

   ```bash
   # Switch to the 'staging' branch
   git checkout staging

   # Merge changes from 'main' into 'staging'
   git merge main

   # Push the updates to the remote repository
   git push
   ```

2. **After testing, merge `staging` into `deploy` to deploy:**  

   ```bash
   # Switch to the 'deploy' branch
   git checkout deploy

   # Merge changes from 'staging' into 'deploy'
   git merge staging

   # Push the updates to the remote repository
   git push
   ```

### Reverting if Something Breaks  

If something breaks in `deploy`, you can revert to the last working state using:  

   ```bash
   git checkout deploy
   git reset --hard <last-working-commit-hash>
   git push --force origin deploy
   ```

### PS

Special thanks to **[@Giorgiark](https://github.com/Giorgiark)**, whose GitHub repository [**`Giorgiark/pomodorotimer`**](https://github.com/giorgiark/pomodorotimer/) provided the initial inspiration for this project. While my implementation differs significantly and expands upon the original idea, I built upon the base template and color scheme tailored for Notion Spaces that Giorgiark had already established.  

Although the original repository did not include a license, I want to acknowledge and give full credit to **[@Giorgiark](https://github.com/Giorgiark)** for their foundational work and inspiration for this project.
